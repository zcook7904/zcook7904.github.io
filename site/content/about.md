My name is Zaven Cook and I work as a junior Mechanical Engineer in EXP's San Francisco Office. At EXP, I design HVAC systems for science and tech companies.

I graduated from Clemson University in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, in addition to a minor in Mathematical Sciences.

This website showcases personal projects created and things I've learned related to Computer Science, Math, and Mechanical Engineering.
