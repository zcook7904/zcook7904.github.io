<h2>What is the San Francisco Plum Finder?</h2>
<p><a href="/sf_plum_finder_app"> The SF Plum Finder</a> is a simple web app that allows a user to find the location of
    the nearest plum tree to a given address, either by using the SF_plum_finder python module, or by texting the address to a certain number connected to Twilio.
    This post is meant to give an overview of the program, with more focus applied to the data processing and python module.
    The program itself is written entirely in python and uses the googlemaps API for location services and the Twilio API to handle SMS reception and creation.
    Additionally, I used pandas to process and work with the tree data.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/PlumFinderFlowChart.jpg" align="middle" alt="Basic Flow Chart of Plum Finder Program" />
        <figcaption><em>A broad overview of SF Plum Finder</em></figcaption>
    </p>
    <p>The repo containing the python module is located here:
    <a href="https://github.com/zcook7904/SF_plum_finder">github.com/zcook7904/SF_plum_finder</a>. The python module itself can be found at:
        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/SF-plum-finder/">pypi.org/project/SF-plum-finder/</a>.</p>
<h2>The data</h2>
<p>This project is only possible because of the <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Tree-List/tkzw-k3nq">
    SF Street Tree List</a> hosted on <a href="https://datasf.org/"> dataSF.org</a>.
    The SF Street Tree list contains over 196,000 (!) trees and includes addresses, species, geolocations (latitude and longitude),
    and where at the address the tree is located (front yard, sidewalk, etc.) for most trees in the database,
    along with some other information that are less useful for this application. </p>
<p>
    <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/SFTreeDataHead.png" align="middle" alt="The first few columns of SF Street Tree List" />
    <figcaption><em>A few columns of the SF Street Tree List shown in Excel with some less useful columns hidden</em></figcaption>

<p>It was immediately noticeable that a lot of the data were missing geolocation (latitude and longitude),
    even though they were not missing an address. An important part of the algorithm I developed to find the closest
    plum tree required not just the address, but the geolocation as well. I made a quick function that used Google Maps API to add the geolocation
to trees with proper addresses, but not geolocations. This was accomplished by first selecting all trees with null geolocations
    and non-null addresses, and then further filtering out street addresses that were not related to an actual geolocation, such as "STAIRWAY":</p>
<p>
    <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/add_geolocation_filter.PNG" align="middle" alt="Pandas codes to filter trees appropriate for adding geolocation" />
    <figcaption><em>Filtering out inappropriate addresses</em></figcaption>
</p> <p></p>
<p>
    Now that I had a series of addresses without geolocations, getting the geolocations was as simple as iterating through this series, sending the
    address to the Google Maps' client library "get_geolocation" function, and saving the treeID and new geocoordinates to an empty data frame made earlier:
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/add_geolocation.PNG" align="middle" alt="Code to get geolocation from address and save to dataframe" />
    <figcaption><em>Getting geolocation from address</em></figcaption>

<p>
    Important to note in the above code is the "changes" variable. The purpose of this variable was to keep track of the number of google API calls.
    After a certain number (typically 1000), the program asks the user if they want to continue adding geolocations. If the user inputs "n", the function ends.
    This was to protect myself from obscene google API bills if there was any bug in the function, or
    if in the future different data is used with the function that has an unexpectedly large amount of addresses the geolocation can be applied to.
    In this case, the number of addresses the geolocation was added to was just under 500.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, the original dataframe is updated with the new added geolocations:
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/update_geolocation.PNG" align="middle" alt="Code to update geolocations and return updated dataframe" />
    <figcaption><em>Updating the dataframe with added geolocations</em></figcaption>
</p>
<p>
    Next, a similar procedure was followed to add addresses to trees that had geolocations but not addresses.
    This process was more straightforward, as the geolocations were assumed to be correct if the address was missing.
    After filtering to only include trees with geolocations but not addresses, a simple map was applied that mapped addresses
    retrieved from Google Maps' reverse geocode API housed in the 'get_address' function:
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/add_addresses.PNG" align="middle" alt="Code to map addresses to trees that are missing them" />
    <figcaption><em>Adding addresses</em></figcaption>
</p>
<p>
    The final cleaning applied to all the data was implemented after looking into the data further.
    While checking to see if the geolocation and address adding were working properly,
    I noticed there were many trees with the same address but with geolocations over 5000m away from each other:
</p>
<p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='sf_plum_finder_post/check_geocodes.PNG" align="middle" alt="Inspecting geocodes" />
    <figcaption><em>Inspecting geocodes</em></figcaption>
</p>
<p>
    After applying the same check to the original data to make sure the error was in the data and not my code,
    I entered the geolocations into Google Maps and determined that in every case one of the trees had a matching
    address and geolocation, while the other’s geolocation indicated a completely different address.
    Consequently, I assumed the geolocations were correct and the addresses had been entered incorrectly.
    I filtered the addresses with probable incorrect addresses similarly to above by:
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/getting_bad_addresses.PNG" align="middle" alt="Inspecting geocodes" />
    <figcaption><em>Inspecting geocodes</em></figcaption>
</p>
<p>
    And then mapped the correct address from Google Maps to every tree in the filtered list in the same manner as above.
</p>
<p>
    At this point, it’s important to note that for this specific application it was unnecessary to apply these functions
    to the total SF Street Tree data. I could've saved some computation time and filtered out the plums from the data first.
    While the program would’ve run faster and less
    Google Maps API budget would’ve been used, I wanted to have all the data as clean as possible for later projects
    and further analysis.
</p>
<p>
    That being said, after this initial processing I was finally ready to filter out the plum trees from the rest of the data.
    This was done simply enough using pandas .loc function to select trees with “plum”
    in the species names (but not “plume”).
    Additionally, trees that were located in back or front yards were removed as well as trees that didn’t
    have geolocations or valid addresses. Finally, the cleaned up, plum-only dataframe was saved as a new csv file to
    be used with the actual tree finder program.
</p>
<h2>The plum finding program</h2>
<p>
The basic sequence of the program is as follows:
<ol>
    <li>The user inputs a street address</li>
<li>The program checks if the address is acceptable, i.e. it:
    <ol>
    <li>Ensures the address has all the required components (street number, street name, street suffix) and</li>
    <li>That the street exists in San Francisco</li>
        </ol>
<li>Converts the address to a geolocation using Google Maps trusty geocode API</li>
<li>Computes the geometric distance from that geolocation to every tree in the dataframe</li>
<li>Selects the n (in this case 5) closest trees from the dataframe</li>
<li>Sends these 5 trees addresses to Google Map’s distance matrix API to get the actual distances and</li>
<li>Finally, returns the actual closest tree to the user</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    Specifically, a street address is passed to the programs main function, where it is converted to an address dataclass that
    allows all the components of the address (the street number, street name, full address, latitude and longitude, etc.)
    to be stored in one place and accessed easily.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/address_dataclass.PNG" align="middle" alt="Address dataclass initiation" />
    <figcaption><em>The initiation portion of the address dataclass</em></figcaption>
</p>
<p>
    This address then is passed to a processing function that ensures the address is valid
    for San Francisco. It does so by first ensuring the number of 'components' of the address are at least 3 --
    street number, street name, and street type -- and then ensuring the street number is an integer and that the
    street name is in the SF_street_names database. Great care is taken here in order to minimize calls to the Google Maps API with
    improper addresses.
</p>
<p>
    Next, Google Maps is used to assign a latitude and longitude to the address just as it was done when processing the tree data.
    With the geolocation assigned to the address, it is now trivial to use numpy to compute the geometric distance to each plum tree from
    the inputted location:
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/geometric_distance_calc.PNG" align="middle" alt="Geometric distance calculation" />
    <figcaption><em>Calculating the geometric distance to every plum tree</em></figcaption>
</p>
<p>
    This calculation serves as an approximation of the walking distance to every plum tree in San Francisco. This is an important step,
    as Google Maps distance matrix only allows up to 25 destinations per API call. Without this initial approximation,
    it would take almost 270 API calls to determine the distance to each tree using Google Maps. Even with asynchronous calls,
    this would be orders of magnitude slower (and more expensive) than the approximation approach.
</p>
<p>
    Instead of doing this, the distance is approximated and the n <= 25 geometrically closest plum trees are passed to
    the Google Maps API. I performed some experimentation on what number of possible closest locations needed to be passed
    to the API to include the actual closest by walking distance. I found that the closest geographically was typically at worst the
    second or third closest geometrically. Even so, more testing is needed to see how true this actually is, and even if
    25 trees are needed to always return the actual closest result, any number of trees less than 26 has a negligibly different computational cost.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless, the addresses of the trees approximated as closest are passed to Google Maps distance matrix API along with the inputted
    address. The API, aptly named, returns a matrix of distances from the origin point to the passed destination points.
    The distances are returned in the same order they are passed, so it is simple enough to then match the addresses to the distances:
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/distance_matrix.PNG" align="middle" alt="Distance matrix call" />
    <figcaption><em>Getting the walking distance to every tree</em></figcaption>
</p>
<p>
    This list is sorted by distance and the address to the corresponding shortest distance is then used to query the
    plum tree dataframe for the tree itself.
    This tree is returned as a dictionary to later be formatted in whatever means deemed necessary:
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/make_response.PNG" align="middle" alt="Returning the closest tree" />
    <figcaption><em>Returning the closest tree</em></figcaption>
</p>
<p>
    Sorting is unnecessary for the program, but was done to perform later analysis on the difference between the
    approximated and actual closest tree.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless, the actual plum finding portion of the program was complete and could be tested through a simple command line interface:
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/sf_plum_finder_post/command_line_interface.PNG" align="middle" alt="Command line interface working" />
    <figcaption><em>Plum found!</em></figcaption>
</p>
<h2>SMS Interface</h2>
<p>
    The final component of the program was the SMS interface. This was achieved fairly simply by using Twilio and flask.
    First, I set up a flask application that accepted POST requests and, if the request was a proper address (see above),
    returned the closest plum tree in response.
</p>
<p>
    To make development easier, I decided the plum finding portion of the program would be its own python module that the
    flask application/web server would install separately. This way, I could make changes to the plum finding portion on
    my own computer and then update the module on the server using pip.
</p>
<p>
    I also decided to host the app (really a router) as part of this website on <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">pythonanywhere.com</a>,
    as the server was very easy to set up and was already configured to run python.
</p>
<p>
    The mechanism of the SMS portion operates like this:
    <ol>
    <li>First, the user sends a text to a predetermined number connected to my Twilio account</li>
    <li>Twilio then makes a post request to the http address I have configured on the server with the users message and
        some other information as the body of the request</li>
    <li>The server then ensures the phone number that sent an SMS to Twilio is whitelisted</li>
    <li>And then finally passes the body of the message (what the users text) to the main SF_plum_finder function and</li>
    <li>Returns to the original user whatever the function returns, with some additional error handling</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    All together the end results looks like this:

<h2>Final notes</h2>
<p>While the program itself works as I initially intended it, there are still a lot of features missing that could be added in the future,
as well as some improvements to the program itself. First, a lot of the functionality of the whitelist needs to be fleshed out.
This includes granting access levels and logging the number of times a user uses the service and some more safeguards to
prevent accidental (or purposeful) spamming of the Google API. Additionally, a complete means of error logging is yet to be
implemented outside of user input errors being handled. I'd also like to move away from using the Google Maps API as much,
something I believe can be achieved both by implementing a look-up of the
    <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Addresses-Enterprise-Addressing-System/3mea-di5p">San Francisco Address Database</a>,
and by potentially using other geolocating API's. Finally, I would like to further research the effectiveness of approximating the walking distance
using geometric distance and where that works well or doesn't work within the city.</p>
